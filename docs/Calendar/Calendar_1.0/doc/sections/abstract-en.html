<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
Ontology to capture concepts related to a calendar. Reuses some terms from schema.org. 
Beyond the representation of individual timepoints and time intervals, there is often a requirement to reference concepts from a calendar. These calendar concepts provide means of describing some reoccurring objects in time, it is important to note that calendar concepts are distinct from timepoints or intervals that may be characterized with these concepts. In fact, calendar concepts, such as a day of the week, or a month implicitly refer to a class of time objects. Further consideration of the formalization of this relationship should be addressed in future work. 
Here, we define calendar concepts specific to the Gregorian calendar. If required, concepts from other sorts of calendars could be included here as well. These calendar concepts are required to capture properties such as hours of operation, transit schedules, parking policies, and so on.</span>
