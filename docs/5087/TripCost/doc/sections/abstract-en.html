<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
Different costs are associated with the performance of Trips. These may take the form of direct costs such as those presented in the Travel Cost Ontology, but there are also possible indirect costs such as vehicle wear and tear, gas, etc. In addition, there may be non-monetary costs associated with travel over different arcs such as pollution and travel time. Trip Costs capture these indirect costs that may vary between individual trips; a trip cost is a property of some instance of travelling.</span>
