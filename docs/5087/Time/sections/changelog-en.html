<ul>
<li>Added: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#note> "A designated timezone is associated with a geographic region. However, for a particular region the offset from UTC often varies seasonally, and the dates of the changes may vary from year to year. The timezone designation usually changes for the different seasons (e.g. Australian Eastern Standard Time vs. Australian Eastern Daylight Time). Furthermore, the offset for a timezone may change over longer timescales, though its designation might not.  

Detailed guidance about working with time zones is given in http://www.w3.org/TR/timezone/ ."@en</li>
<li>Added: rdfs:comment "A Time Zone specifies the amount by which the local time is offset from UTC. 
	A time zone is usually denoted geographically (e.g. Australian Eastern Daylight Time), with a constant value in a given region. 
The region where it applies and the offset from UTC are specified by a locally recognised governing authority."@en</li>

<li>Added: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#historyNote> "In the original 2006 version of OWL-Time, the TimeZone class, with several properties corresponding to a specific model of time-zones, was defined in a separate namespace \"http://www.w3.org/2006/timezone#\". 

In the current version a class with same local name is put into the main OWL-Time namespace, removing the dependency on the external namespace. 

An alignment axiom 
	tzont:TimeZone rdfs:subClassOf time:TimeZone . 
allows data encoded according to the previous version to be consistent with the updated ontology. "^^xsd:string</li>
