<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
Many of the concepts identified in the urban system ontologies are subject to change. For example, a Vehicle will have one location at one time, and another location at a later time; it may have only one passenger at one time, and four passengers at a later time. Similarly, many attributes of Persons, Households, and even Transportation Networks are subject to change. An approach to representing changing properties, or fluents, that leverages the 4-dimensionalist perspective was proposed by (Welty, Fikes, and Makarios, 2006). We adopt a similar approach, based on a re-interpretation by Krieger (2008) requiring the division of classes that are subject to change into two parts: invariant and variant parts of the concept; we refer to these as TimeVaryingConcept and Manifestation classes, respectively. By distinguishing between these class types and recognizing the properties that are (and aren't) subject to change, the ontology supports the capture of both the static and dynamic aspects of a particular entity. </span>
