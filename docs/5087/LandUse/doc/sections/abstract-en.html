<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Land Use Pattern captures concepts related to land use and cover over time. 
Land Use Classifications provide a means of describing the land cover/use in a standard way. Various classification systems are used to identify types of land use. Currently, we include LBCS, CLUMP, and AAFC.
The ontology reuses and extends the Land Based Classification Standards (LBCS) Ontology  presented by (Montenegro, Gomes, Urbano, and Duarte, 2011) for this purpose.</span>
