<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
A contract is a legal document that specifies some agreement(s) between two or more parties. The aim of the Contract Ontology is not to formalize the semantics of all possible involved legal concepts, but rather to enable to representation of the general structure and contents of a particular contract. The Contract Ontology adopts the definition of Contract specified in the Financial Business Ontology (FIBO) [8] specified at: https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Agreements/Contracts/ with a key modification that a Contract is defined as a type of Document and is distinct from an Agreement (not a subclass, as specified in FIBO).</span>
