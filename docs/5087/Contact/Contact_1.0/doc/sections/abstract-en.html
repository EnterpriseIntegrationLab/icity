<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
Ontology to capture concepts related to contact information (addresses, phone numbers). Reuses the iContact Ontology developed by the Enterprise Integration Lab in Toronto. The iContact ontology is extended to introduce a specialized definition of Hours of Operation, defined as a subclass of both the iContact definition of hours of operation, and a subclass of the Recurring Event class defined in the iCity Recurring Event ontology.
The Contact ontology also extends the definition of address to include an associated location.</span>
