<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
To capture generic spatial features we require concepts of location, but also concepts of geometry in order to describe shapes that are more complex than a single point in space. To achieve this, we combine an ontology of longitude and latitude, with simple spatial and geometry ontologies.

This ontology was created to organize the reuse of the geoSPARQL vocabulary in the iCity ontology.</span>
