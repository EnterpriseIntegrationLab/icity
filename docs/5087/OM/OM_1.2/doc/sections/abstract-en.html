<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
Ontology to capture concepts related to measurements in order to provide a structured vocabulary to describe, among other things, the different values (measures) that we associate to given quantities. This allows us to provide greater detail regarding specific measurements that are defined in the ontology. Rather than simply have a simple data property to describe the length of some road segment as "10 m", with the units of measure ontology we are able to describe the nature of the quantity (i.e. length), its value as a Measure (10 m), and also describe the unit that the measure's numerical value is given in (e.g. metres).
		The iCity-OM Ontology reuses a small subset of the entire Units of Measure (OM) ontology.</span>
