<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
This ontology provides a generic representation of resources that contain core properties generic across all transportation uses. We take the view presented in the TOVE model (Fadel, Fox, and Gruninger, 1994) that "...being a resource is not an innate property of an object but a property that is derived from the role the object plays with respect to an activity". The definition of  a resource is dependent on its participation in an activity occurrence, so the Resource ontology is in fact an extension of the Activity ontology. In this sense, Resources are a class of manifestations, so that rather than have a specialized Resource-perdurant (PD) class, a Resource is a manifestation of some other perdurant class in the ontology. For example, an instance of a Vehicle that is a manifestation of some VehiclePD may also be an instance of a resource, whereas some other instance of a Vehicle that is some later manifestation of the same VehiclePD may not be a Resource, or it may be a different Resource.
